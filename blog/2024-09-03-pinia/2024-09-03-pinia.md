## Using Pinia for state management in Vue apps

### üçç What is Pinia?

Pinia allows you to store data and methods (aka variables and functions) in a central way, and import them to different components throughout your app. This can simplify your code by importing and using variables and functions _only_ in the components where they are needed. This avoids prop drilling and several layers of callback functions!

_Here is the [documentation](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/). üìñ_

### When to use it?

‚úÖ¬†Use Pinia to store any data and methods that need to be **accessible across multiple components**. Ex:

- `myData` needs to be set in `Component.vue`, but displayed in `SiblingComponent.vue`
- `Component.vue` needs to fetch data based on some action in that component, but `SiblingComponent.vue` needs to display, edit or remove the same data.
- `myData` and `otherData` are rendered in different components, but are both used in a third component to calculate some outcome.

‚ùå¬†Do **not** use Pinia for data that is only used **temporarily**, or in a **single component**. Ex:

- `Component.vue` temporarily sets a `selectedItem` - some function is performed on the selected item, then it clears when a new item is selected.
- `Component.vue` uses `specificData` that never needs to be passed to or used in other components.

### How to use it?

#### Create a store üèóÔ∏è

First, create your store file and name it with this pattern: `useExampleStore.js`

- i.e. `use` + `YourStoreName` + `Store`
- so for example, for [RMT](/docs/category/rmt)'s disease status data: `useDiseaseStatusStore.js`

Step-by-step instructions in comments below.
You can look at examples in the codebase in `client > src > stores`.

```js
// ******* STEP 1: import defineStore at the top *******
import { defineStore } from "pinia";

// ******* STEP 2: export your store, and after defineStore, give your store a unique descriptive name *******
export const useExampleStore = defineStore("example", {
  // ******* STEP 3: define your data/variables in state *******
  state: () => ({
    myVariable: [],
    anotherVariable: "I ‚ù§Ô∏è Pinia",
  }),

  // ******* STEP 4: define your functions/methods in "actions" *******
  actions: {
    async myFunction(params) {
      // your code...
    },
    anotherFunction() {
      // your code...
    },
  },
});

// ******* THAT'S IT! Congrats :) *******
```

#### Use a store üß§

Here‚Äôs a üé¨¬†[how-to video](https://vueschool.io/lessons/access-pinia-state-in-the-options-api)

Process to use stored data or methods in any component is:

1. In `<script>`, import:
   1. the correct store
   2. `mapState` if you‚Äôre using data/variables
   3. `mapActions` if you‚Äôre using functions/methods

```js
import { useExampleStore } from "@/stores/useExampleStore";
import { mapState, mapActions } from "pinia";
```

2. For data/variables, add a `computed` property in your `<script>`, and use `mapState` to destructure your stored data:

```js
computed: {
    ...mapState(useExampleStore, ['myVariable', 'anotherVariable'])
        },
```

3. For functions/methods, use `mapActions` in your `methods` to destructure the stored functions. You do not need to include params, just function names:

```js
methods: {
        ...mapActions(useExampleStore, ['myFunction', 'anotherFunction'])
        },
```

4. Then you can use as usual! i.e. Use the variables in your `<template>`, call the functions, etc., with the same syntax as if they were standard `data` or `methods`.

```html
<div>
  <select @change="myFunction(value)">
    <option v-for="item in myVariable" :key="item.id" :value="item.name">
      {{ item.name }}
    </option>
  </select>
</div>
```
