# Overview

The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), established in 1954, is dedicated to combating foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) across Europe. Operating under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, EuFMD collaborates with Member Nations and European neighbors to enhance preparedness and implement sustainable control programs. It also supports the global strategy for the progressive control of FMD and similar transboundary animal diseases (FAST) through partnerships with the European Commissionâ€™s DG-SANTE, the FAO, and the World Organisation for Animal Health.
