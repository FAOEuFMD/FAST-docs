# VADEMOS Maintenance Plan: A Guide for Data Scientists  

Maintaining the VADEMOS tool requires attention to both **data updates** and **application/server upkeep**. Below is a structured overview of the key maintenance activities:  

---

## 1. Data Maintenance  

### 1.1. VADEMOS Database and AWS Maintenance  
- **Database Licenses**: Ensure that all AWS-related licenses (e.g., RDS instance) are renewed on time. Monitor database usage and ensure that resources (e.g., storage, CPU) align with the needs of the VADEMOS tool.  
- **AWS Backups**: Regularly back up the database to prevent data loss. Implement automated daily backups using AWS RDS features or similar tools. Verify backups quarterly.  
- **Database Performance**: Optimize queries and indices periodically to maintain performance as data grows. Monitor slow queries using AWS monitoring tools.  

### 1.2. FAO Dataset Updates  
- **Frequency**: The FAO dataset is updated annually. When a new dataset is available, update the corresponding database table in VADEMOS.  
- **Steps to Update**:  
  - Download the updated FAO dataset.  
  - Preprocess the data to ensure it aligns with the format and schema used in the database.  
  - Replace the outdated dataset in the database and test the app for any changes.  
- **Verification**: Cross-check key statistics (e.g., population trends) before finalizing the update.  

### 1.3. Population Prediction  
- **Yearly Run**: Use the updated FAO dataset to generate new population predictions for the next 10 years using the AutoEnsemble model.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Rerun the AutoEnsemble script with the new dataset.  
  - Update the `forecasted_data` table with the newly generated population predictions.  
  - Validate predictions using historical trends.  
- **Timing**: This should be done annually after the FAO dataset is updated.  

### 1.4. Density Data Updates  
- **Frequency**: Gridded Livestock (GLW4) datasets are updated periodically (e.g., 2018, 2022). Monitor FAO for new releases.  
- **Steps to Update**:  
  - Download the latest GLW4 dataset.  
  - Rerun the GIS processing pipeline to recalculate density data (zonal statistics).  
  - Update the `density` table in the database.  
- **Verification**: Ensure that calculated densities match expected values by sampling a few administrative regions.

## 2. Application and Server Maintenance  

### 2.1. Shiny App Updates  
- **Code Updates**: Review and update the app code for any deprecated functions or packages. Perform this check biannually or when a major R version is released.  
- **Package Management**:  
  - Regularly update R and R packages used in the app.  
  - Test the app locally after each update to ensure no compatibility issues arise.  
- **Feature Enhancements**: Periodically review user feedback for new feature requests or usability improvements.  

### 2.2. Server Monitoring and Security  
- **Resource Monitoring**: Use AWS CloudWatch or similar tools to monitor server performance (e.g., CPU usage, memory, and disk space).  
- **Scaling**: Adjust instance size or auto-scaling policies to handle increasing traffic.  
- **Security**:  
  - Ensure that all server endpoints are secured with HTTPS.  
  - Regularly rotate database credentials and AWS keys.  
  - Monitor for unauthorized access attempts using AWS CloudTrail.  

### 2.3. Regular Testing  
- **Functionality Tests**: Test the app's core functionalities after any update to the database, density data, or FAO dataset.  
- **User Interface (UI)**: Review the UI for any display issues or responsiveness problems on different devices.  
- **Load Testing**: Perform load testing annually to ensure the app can handle peak traffic.

## 3. General Maintenance Activities  

### 3.1. Documentation Updates  
- Keep all documentation (e.g., maintenance steps, data pipelines, user guides) updated after every major change to the system.  
- Maintain a changelog for every modification made to the app or database.  

### 3.2. Disaster Recovery  
- **Backup Testing**: Periodically restore backups in a test environment to ensure data recovery processes are functioning correctly.  
- **Failover Plan**: Implement a disaster recovery plan with a backup server or database instance in a different region for high availability.  

### 3.3. User Access Management  
- Regularly review user access permissions for both the database and the app. Ensure that access is granted only to authorized personnel.

## Summary of Key Maintenance Intervals  

| **Activity**                | **Frequency**            |  
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|  
| FAO Dataset Update          | Annually                |  
| Population Prediction        | Annually (post FAO update) |  
| Gridded Livestock Update     | When new data is available (e.g., 4-5 years) |  
| App Code Updates             | Biannually or as needed |  
| Database Backups             | Daily (Automated)       |  
| Security and Monitoring      | Monthly                 |  
| Load Testing                 | Annually                |  

By adhering to this maintenance plan, the VADEMOS tool will remain reliable, efficient, and up-to-date.
