## **What is VADEMOS?**
VADEMOS (**Vaccine Demand Estimation Model for Foot-and-Mouth Disease - FMD**) is a **decision-support tool** designed to estimate current and future **vaccine dose demand** at national and regional levels.

- Estimates **prophylactic vaccination** needs based on **PCP-FMD stage** and species-specific **vaccination schedules**.
- Provides **emergency vaccination** estimates using **density data** and **user-defined outbreak radius**.
- Interactive **web application** with **data visualization, mapping, and reporting capabilities**.
