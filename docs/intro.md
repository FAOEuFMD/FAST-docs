# Introduction

Welcome to the EuFMD Technical Documentation.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to all EuFMD tools and dashboards, providing developers, system administrators, and other stakeholders with detailed information on how to effectively use, configure, and manage the tools built by the EuFMD.

This documentation is a work in progress.

Feel free to contribute over at [EuFMD FAST docs](https://github.com/FAOEuFMD/FAST-docs).

## About the EuFMD Program

The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), established in 1954, is dedicated to combating foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) across Europe. Operating under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, EuFMD collaborates with Member Nations and European neighbors to enhance preparedness and implement sustainable control programs. It also supports the global strategy for the progressive control of FMD and similar transboundary animal diseases (FAST) through partnerships with the European Commissionâ€™s DG-SANTE, the FAO, and the World Organisation for Animal Health.

The new program started in September 2023 and will run until 2027.
